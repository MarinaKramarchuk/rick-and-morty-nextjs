## 📁 Project Structure

* `/app` — Routing and Page components (using the new async params logic).
* `/components` — Reusable UI components (CharacterCard, Grid, SidebarFilter).
* `/lib/api` — Logic for API requests with standardized error handling.
* `/types` — TypeScript interfaces for Characters, Episodes, and Locations.

## 📝 Development Highlights

- **Async Params**: Implemented the new Next.js 15 requirement for unwrapping `params` and `searchParams`.
- **LCP Optimization**: Used the `priority` property in `next/image` for "above the fold" images to improve Core Web Vitals.
- **Sticky Sidebar**: Implemented a desktop-only sticky sidebar for a better UX when browsing long lists.
